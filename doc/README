... And also the sound I issued many times implementing email autoresponding.


What is GNARWL
--------------

Gnarwl is a email autoreply/vacation agent, intented to be used on mailservers,
where users may not (nescessarily) have systemaccoounts, but accountinformation 
is stored within an LDAP database.

What are the features of gnarwl ?
---------------------------------

- User information is stored in LDAP, no shellaccounts required.
- Configurable via single systemwide configuration file.
- Per user locking of sent email (to prevent mail loops).
- No more messing around with individual .forward files, all userdata is kept 
  in LDAP.
- Configureable header matching (to avoid sending mail to mailing lists).
- Blacklisting of addresses, that may not use the autoresponder.
- Forceable header/footer on outgoing mail.
- Status reports via syslog.
- Not bound to a particular MTA (though postfix is recommended).
